Anna: Hi, Tom. Let me tell you what a regular day at our company normally looks like. We start at 9. The first thing to do is log in to your computer and check your emails.

Tom: Sounds good. What do I do after checking emails?

Anna: After that, you'll probably attend the daily team meeting at 9:30. During the meeting, the team discusses project updates.

Tom: I see. What about the rest of the day?

Anna: During the rest of the day, you usually work on your design projects, collaborate with the team, and attend meetings with clients when there are those meetings.

Tom: What time do we have our lunch break?

Anna: You have a one-hour lunch break around noon every day. Bring your lunch or go to one of the cafés nearby. The people from the team often do this.

Tom: How long are our workdays?

Anna: We typically finish at about 5, but that depends on project deadlines.

Tom: Thanks for explaining, Anna. It helps me to understand what to expect.

Anna: You're welcome, Tom.
